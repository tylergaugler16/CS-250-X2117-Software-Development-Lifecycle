_How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?_
By dissecting a user feature into the smallest sized chunks so that each can deliver value on it's own. You never want to work on large features, but you also never want to deliver something that doesn't have any real value. So it's hard to find the balance, but that's what you should always aim for. User storeis are what defines these tasks and they make it helpful to estimate how long it will take which in turn helps understand how to prioritize it among other user stories. 

_How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?_
I like the idea of always being ready to take a step back re-plan. You never know what will come up, and you may need to reasses things. That's not a bad thing, nor does it mean your're a bad planner. Ignoring the items that come up is dangerous as at that point you are prioritizing a process and not a product. 

_What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?_
Being a good team member is all about doing your role as best as you can. It's also about being a transfapernet and hoesnt person, someones who is able to nicetly, but effectively lead people down better paths. When people are concerned with others development and growth it trnslates into a very strong team.
